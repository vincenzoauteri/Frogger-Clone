# Frogger-Clone

Save the princess(es) by crossing the bug-infested roads !

Play it at http://vincenzoauteri.github.io/Frogger-Clone

Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to move your character.

The goal is to reach the tile with the princess on the topmost row.

There are four levels of increasing difficulty, complete them without losing your 3 lives to get to the ending !

The game will start automatically upon page load, and will restart from Level 1 if you lose all lives.
